# Node.js Sample Project for Visual Studio Remote - Containers

This is a sample project to go along with the "try" quick start for the VS Code Remote - Containers extension.

Using the sample:

1. **[Windows]** Disable automatic line ending conversion for Git on the *Windows side* (given Linux and Windows use different line endings). Run: `git config --global core.autocrlf false`
2. Follow the steps at [https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).
3. Run `yarn install`
4. Launch the application, edit, and try things out!
