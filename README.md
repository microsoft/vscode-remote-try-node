# Try Out Development Containers: Node.js

This is a sample project that lets you try out the **[VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)** extension in a few easy steps.

> **Note:** If you're following the quick start, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.

## Setting up the development container

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

    - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Try a Sample...** command.
    - Choose the "Node" sample, wait for the container to start and try things out!
        > **Note:** Under the hood, this will use **Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem.

    Or open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!
## Things to try

Once you have this sample opened in a container, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

> **Note:** This container runs as a non-root user with sudo access by default. Comment out `"remoteUser": "node"` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` if you'd prefer to run as root.

Some things to try:

1. **Edit:**
   - Open `server.js`
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features. Notice that `eslint` and the `vscode-eslint` extension are already installed in the container.
2. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `uname` and other Linux commands from the terminal window.
3. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Open `server.js`
   - Add a breakpoint (e.g. on line 20).
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
   - Continue and from the notification that is shown open a browser. Note you can connect to the server in the container. 
   - The status line shows '1 Port Available'. Clicking the status bar entry shows the 'Ports' view that lists the currently available ports.
4. **Forward a port statically:** You can also forward a port statically in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.
   - Open the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.
   - Uncomment the `forwardedPorts` attribute and adjust the port number as needed.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command so the modifications are picked up.
